		In this page, a breif history about coffee in general is given. Where the coffee began and what it reached nowadays.
	<p>
	<h3>Ethiopia</h3>

    <p class="p_content">The coffee plant, which was discovered in Ethiopia in the 11th Century, has a white blossom that smells like jasmine and a red, cherry-like fruit. 
	Back then, the leaves of the so-called "magical fruit" were boiled in water and the resulting concoction was thought to have medicinal properties.
	As the fame of the coffee plant spread to other lands, its centuries-long voyage was about to begin. <a href="http://www.turkishcoffeeworld.com/History-of-Coffee-s/60.htm" class="w3-hover-text-green">History of coffee</a></p>

	<p class="p_content">
	Coffee spread quickly through the Arabian Peninsula. In the mid 14th century, coffee cultivation reached Yemen 
	and for 300 years, 
	it was drunk following the recipe first used in Ethiopia. 
	Yemen's climate and fertile soil offered the ideal conditions for cultivating rich coffee harvests.<a href="http://www.turkishcoffeeworld.com/History-of-Coffee-s/60.htm" class="w3-hover-text-green">History of coffee</a>

	<h3>America</h3>

	<p class="p_content">
	Coffee reached North America in 1668. The first coffeehouse in New York, "The King's Arms", opened in 1696.
	In 1714, the Dutch presented Louis XIV with a coffee sapling from their plantations on Java. The sapling was planted in the royal Jardin des Plantes in Paris.
	In 1723, a French mariner named Gabriel du Clieu took a sapling from the Jardin des Plantes to the island of Martinique. From here, the coffee plant spread to other Caribbean islands, 
	as well as to Central and South America.
	In 1727, a Portuguese sailor named de Mello Palheta carried coffee saplings to Brazil from French Guyana. Today, Brazil is the number one producer of coffee in the world, accounting for 
	35% of global coffee production.
	In 1730, the British began cultivating coffee in Jamaica.
	By the mid 19th century, coffee had become one of the most important commodities in world trade. <a href="http://www.turkishcoffeeworld.com/History-of-Coffee-s/60.htm" class="w3-hover-text-green">History of coffee</a>
